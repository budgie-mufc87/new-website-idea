 <h2>My Bucket List</h2>
<Img src="Images/albufeira portugal.jpg" alt="a picture of albufeira beach">
    <p>Albufeira – Portugal: - I would really like to visit the Algarve in Portugal & one of the destinations recommended to me was Albufeira. It is one of the largest cities in the Algarve, it is known for its long sandy beaches, Restaurants, Nightlife with Bars and clubs. There is also the old town which looks like a former fishing village with stunning buildings and villas.</p>
<Img src="Images/cancun mexico.jpg" alt="a picture of Cancun in mexico">
    <p>Cancun, Mexico: - I have also wanted to go to Cancun in Mexico. One of my best friends absolutely raves about the resort. Stunning hotels, Beaches, Food & Historical sites to visit such as, Chichen Itza.</p>
<img src="Images/marmaris turkey.jpg" alt=" a picture of marmaris in turkey">
<P>Marmaris – Turkey: - Marmaris is another place I have dreamed about visiting because it is a well-known Mediterranean resort town along the Turkish Riviera with long beaches and seafront promenade full of cafes, bars and restaurants. It's also known for its lively nightlife on Bar Street, which is home to open-air clubs and music venues.</P>
<img src="Images/rio de janiero.jpg" alt=" a picture of rio de janiero in brazil at night">
<p>Rio De Janeiro – Brazil: - I think I would instantly fall in love with Rio in Brazil because of the friendly people, the food, the amazing weather and of course the Copacabana Beach. Plus, the stunning views in the mountains.</p>
<img src="Images/san andres colombia.jpg" alt="a picture of san andres island a part of colombia">
<p>San Andres – Colombian Island: - is my number one destination to visit in the future. Located in the Caribbean. It has everything you're looking for in an island destination: palm trees, white-sand beaches, crystal clear water, great weather and little islands surrounding it. On this island, you can find yourself amongst beautiful nature unlike anywhere else & it looks like paradise to me.</p>
